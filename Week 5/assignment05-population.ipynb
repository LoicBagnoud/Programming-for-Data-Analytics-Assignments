    "1. Initially, I wasn't sure how I would calculate this and get the number correctly. My research led me to the group.by function which basically allows me to separate the current dataframe into 2 separate ones. One for men and one for women. Afterwards, we can then apply the .average function from Numpy to get the weighted mean. The issue I found with this version is that it's very complicated to then bring the two dataframes back together for further analysis. This ended up being extremely cumbersome, so I abandoned this path. I left it below for insight on my thought process.\n",
    ">\n",
    "2. The second solution was a simpler one. I went ahead and used a basic for loop. First I created a dictionary to store the values in. Then, I looked for unique values in the Sex column (in this case, male and female) and created a smaller dataframe that only contains rows where the Sex column matches the value sex. Afterwards, we apply the numpy function the same way we did to the age column and append those results to the dictionary. \n",
